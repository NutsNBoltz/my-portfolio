			<h2>About Me</h2>

				Hi, my name is Hasan. I'm a first-year Software Engineering student with a strong curiosity for how things work —
				whether it's hardware, code, or systems. Ever since I was a kid, I've loved taking gadgets apart 
				(sometimes putting them back together), and that passion naturally led me to software.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading thought-provoking books — one of my favorites is The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. 
				I’m especially interested in how strategy, psychology, and human behavior intersect with technology. 
				I also occasionally journal or write small reflections on what I learn, both in tech and life.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, you might find me playing around with personal coding projects, testing new 
				apps and open-source tools, or watching documentaries on innovation, warfare, or history. 
				I enjoy structured chaos — I like to experiment, fail, learn, and repeat.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m naturally curious, self-driven, and always eager to learn from different people and perspectives. 
				Whether it’s working in a team or figuring something out on my own at 2 a.m., 
				I love the process of building and improving.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this portfolio site is to express my thoughts, share my personal and academic projects, and 
				document my journey as a software engineering student. In addition to showcasing my work, I will also be using 
				this space to publish book reviews from time to time — offering reflections on the ideas, strategies, and insights 
				I gain through reading. This site is a blend of learning, experimentation, and creative expression.
			</p>
